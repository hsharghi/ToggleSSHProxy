# ToggleSSHProxy
AppleScript to toggle SOCK5 proxy setting for Wi-Fi

This script uses [ScriptableStatusBar] (https://github.com/0942v8653/ScriptableStatusBar) to show/hide an icon in status bar. 

# How to use
* Copy `ToggleProxy.scpt` and `sbar` into same directory and run the script. 
* Open script in ScriptEditor app and replace your administrator password with 'ADMIN_PASSWORD' to prevent asking for password each time turning ON/OFF the proxy.
* Script can be opened in ScriptEditor app, and exported as Application for ease of use.
